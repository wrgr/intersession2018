    Prior to this project, I had never coded in Python before, so one of my primary goals was to gain a basic familiarity with the language. As such, I began by reading up on Python and then started working through the content of the neuro-net class that Will shared with us over slack. I first implemented a nearest neighbor classifier, which I then modified to a k-nearest neighbor classifier. This method was very computationally expensive and only yielded a f1_score of 0.739, although it was a useful exercise to familiarize myself with Python. Next, I attempted to implement a Support Vector Machine classifier, and got as far as optimization, but was unable to get gradient descent to work with my program. Finally, I followed a tutorial I found online to implement a simple neural network using tensor flow and achieved a f1_score of 0.89.
