For this assignment, I started by using the grey comatrix to add
features like contrast, dissimilarity, energy, correlation and ASM.
Immediately my f1 score was around .81
I then saw that there was an edge detector function and tried to use that
because in the actual images, synapses looked like edges.
My f1 score dropped below .80 however and I would guess thats because
the images are so magnified that its difficult for the function to truly see
an edge. Finally, I used the Daisy feature descriptors and that easily
put me above .9. I then tweaked the parameters for that function to get a
final score around .91/.92
