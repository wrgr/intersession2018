I used the following features:

1: Median pixel intensity (np.percentile)
2: Calculation of the Froebenius norm (sum of the squared pixel values)
3: Calulation of the sum of the pixel values
4: Metric that weighs extreme values (those close to 0 and those close to 255) the hardest
5: Calculation of how many 'peaks' exist in the data
6: Calulation of the sum of changes between adjacent pixels
7: Contrast feature
The first 4 features ensure that two images with similar metrics have a similar distribution of the pixels (how many are 0, 1, ..., 255).
The last 3 features help ensure that two images with similar metrics have the same shape.
Together, these 7 completely robust features are somewhat accurate in classification.
