For my synchallenge, I utilized percentile, local binary pattern, corner shi tomasi, and gray-scale contrast. Through trial and error, I found that these features provided me with the best f1 score, 0.86. The data provided was in the form of 2000 64x64 arrays. I found myself utilizing powers of 4 when implementing my features, which ended up giving me the best results. I kept the given percentile feature, because it helped with the f1 score. I experimented with other percentages, however, 50 remained the best option, since the 50th percentile is the average. The next feature I chose was local binary pattern, because of the concept of examining a pixels and the pixels surrounding it, which would be useful when identifying synapses, in large dark regions. I chose the nri_uniform method for my feature for its focus on gray scale, and finally choosing 16 points, with radiuses of 8, which I tested out for the best results. The next feature I chose was the corner shi tomasi, which I hoped to detect the few corners in an image holding a synapse. The standard deviation of 4 was calculated from trial and error. The final feature I chose was the Contrast method from the Grey Co Props function. When I first started this project, I actually tried out the contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity, and correlation methods of Grey Co Props. I found that contrast resulted in the best f1 score. I did not include the rest of the methods due to an extremely long run-time.
